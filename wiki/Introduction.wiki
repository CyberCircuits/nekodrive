Introduction

NekoDrive implements the NFS Protocol over Dokan virtual file system and let you mount an NFS export as a standard windows drive.

I started this project in the late 2009 in first instance because I didnt' find any NFS implementation over .NET and because I needed for a project I decided to write my own.
But because NFS is based on RPC, writing my own RPC implementation would have been a big job, so I decided to use ONCRPC for windows http://sourceforge.net/projects/oncrpc-windows/ written in C. I needed to change something in this implementation because it doesn't support the 64bit data and NFS v3 needs this in order to  transfer files > 2GB. Then I wrote a C# wrapper that uses the C++ protocol implementation. You can use directly Neko.NFS as NFS library. I wrote also an NFS client but I thought was a waste of time to create a new filesystem GUI when you already have windows explorer so I started to look for something to join windows FS and NFS and I found Dokan http://dokan-dev.net/en/ . This fantastic library does the job to redirect the OS call to my library that does the job to speak in NFS.
